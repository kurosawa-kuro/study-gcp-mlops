"""Drift detection: ``configmap.example.yaml`` must equal the
``scripts/ci/sync_configmap.render()`` output, AND the generator schema
must cover every key referenced from ``deployment.yaml``.

The committed file is the **canonical artifact** (operators copy +
overlay it before applying). Drift between the committed file and what
``render()`` would produce from ``env/config/setting.yaml`` means
either:

1. Someone hand-edited the committed YAML without bumping setting.yaml
   (the file says "AUTO-GENERATED — do NOT edit by hand").
2. ``setting.yaml::project_id`` was bumped without rerunning
   ``make sync-configmap``.

Either way, ``make apply-manifests`` will deploy a stale ConfigMap. CI
fails fast here so the diff surfaces in the PR.

Also asserts that ``scripts/lib/config.CONFIGMAP_KEYS`` covers every key
referenced via ``configMapKeyRef`` in ``infra/manifests/search-api/deployment.yaml``.
Phase 7 W2-5 で、deployment.yaml が ``configMapKeyRef key=semantic_backend``
を required (Optional: false) 参照するのに、deploy_all overlay が古いキー
列のままだったため Pod が ``CreateContainerConfigError`` で起動失敗した。
本テストは「deployment が参照する全キーを generator が出力する」ことを
構造的に保証する。
