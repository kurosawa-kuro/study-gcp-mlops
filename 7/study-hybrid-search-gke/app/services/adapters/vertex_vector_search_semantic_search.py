"""``SemanticSearchPort`` adapter — Vertex AI Vector Search match endpoint.

Phase 5+ production serving index (PR-1 of `docs/02_移行ロードマップ.md` Wave 1).
The canonical embedding generation history / metadata stays in BigQuery
``feature_mart.property_embeddings``; this adapter only queries the deployed
serving index for ANN top-K and returns ``SemanticResult`` named-tuples.

Filter pushdown:
    Vertex AI Vector Search supports ``restricts`` (categorical tags) and
    ``numeric_restricts`` (numeric ranges) at query time, but those require
    the index to be built with the corresponding metadata. PR-1 does NOT
    implement pushdown — ``filters`` received here are intentionally ignored
    at the ANN layer, and ``BigQueryCandidateRetriever._enrich_from_bq``
    downstream re-applies attribute filters via BigQuery joins on
    ``properties_cleaned``. Track in roadmap §3.1 follow-up if this becomes
    a performance issue (fix = build the index with metadata + pass
    restricts here).

Distance metric:
    Assumes the deployed index uses ``COSINE_DISTANCE`` (matches the BigQuery
    ``VECTOR_SEARCH(..., distance_type => 'COSINE')`` contract used in
    ``BigQuerySemanticSearch``). Similarity is reported as ``1.0 - distance``
    so values land in ``[0, 1]`` with higher = more similar, identical to
    the Phase 5 BigQuery adapter.

    """Phase 5+ production — Vertex AI Vector Search ``find_neighbors``.

    Args:
        index_endpoint_name: Fully-qualified resource name of the deployed
            Vertex AI Index Endpoint, e.g.
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{region}/indexEndpoints/{id}``.
        deployed_index_id: ``DeployedIndex.id`` published on the endpoint
            (matches the ID surfaced by
            ``MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint.deployed_indexes``).
        project: GCP project (used by ``aiplatform.init``).
        location: GCP region — must equal the region the index is deployed
            in (typically ``asia-northeast1`` per Phase 7 non-負 constraint).
        endpoint_factory: optional callable
            ``index_endpoint_name -> MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint``. Tests
            inject a mock here to avoid importing
            ``google.cloud.aiplatform`` and to keep unit tests free of
            credentials. Production leaves this ``None`` so the adapter
            lazy-imports the real SDK on first use.
