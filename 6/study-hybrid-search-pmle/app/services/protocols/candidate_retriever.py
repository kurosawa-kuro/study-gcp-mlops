"""``CandidateRetriever`` Port — hybrid lexical + semantic candidate retrieval.

Implementations: ``BigQueryCandidateRetriever`` (production; runs Meilisearch
or Agent Builder for BM25, BigQuery ``VECTOR_SEARCH`` or Vertex Vector
Search for semantic, then RRF-fuses and enriches with property features
from BigQuery).

Failure semantics: implementations raise on transient backend failures
(empty result is allowed and represented by an empty list). The service
layer is responsible for converting to HTTP 503 / 5xx as appropriate.

    """Hybrid retrieval Port.

    ``query_vector`` is the multilingual-e5 embedding of ``query_text``
    (encoder responsibility, see ``EncoderClient``). The retriever fuses
    lexical + semantic results via RRF then enriches each property_id with
    ``property_features`` (rent, walk_min, age_years, area_m2, ctr, ...)
    pulled from ``properties_cleaned`` / ``property_features_daily``.

    The list is bounded by ``top_k`` after RRF fusion; lexical/semantic
    backends fetch their own internal candidate counts (typically larger
    than ``top_k``) before fusion.

    ``filters`` is a ``SearchFilters`` TypedDict (Phase B-4). At runtime
    it is a plain dict, so adapters that look up keys defensively keep
    working unchanged.
